As i've been asked to fix the issue of e-meeting , let me say there
isn't any solution. You shouldn't trust electronic calendar if you're
not in the same time-zone of sender.

Here are some reasons why time zone changes can be quite complicated:

-  *Every year, a lot of countries switch between Standard Time (ST) and
   Daylight Saving Time (DST), and, unfortunately, they donâ€™t do it at
   the same time. For example, in 2011, Europe switched back from DST to
   ST on Oct 30, while the continental U.S. switched on Nov 6. This
   means that the standard 5 hours difference between New York and
   London was 4 hours between Oct 30 and Nov 6.*
-  *Every year, several countries decide to change their time zones or
   DST rules entirely. Recent examples include Russia, Chile, Belarus,
   and Egypt. Moscow used to be UTC+3 in the winter and UTC+4 during the
   summer, but when Russia decided to stay away from DST as of November
   2011, Moscow became UTC+4 all year round.*

In June we have:

**Rome: UTC+2h**
**London: UTC+1h**

While in February we have:

**Rome: UTC+1h**
**London: UTC**

My suggestion if you have to define a meeting Rome/London is to use
e-mail and standard utc.
